    "[Purpose: Iterative application of Bayes’ rule, and seeing how posterior probabilities change with inclusion of more data.] This exercise extends the ideas of Table 5.4, so at this time, please review Table 5.4 and its discussion in the text. Suppose that the same randomly selected person as in Table 5.4 gets re-tested after the first test result was positive, and on the re-test, the result is negative. When taking into account the results of both tests, what is the probability that the person has the disease? Hint: For the prior probability of the re-test, use the posterior computed from the Table 5.4. Retain as many decimal places as possible, as rounding can have a surprisingly big effect on the results. One way to avoid unnecessary rounding is to do the calculations in R."

    "(B) Take a good look at the frequencies in the table you just computed for the previous part. These are the so-called “natural frequencies” of the events, as opposed to the somewhat unintuitive expression in terms of conditional probabilities (Gigerenzer & Hoffrage, 1995). From the cell frequencies alone, determine **the proportion of people who have the disease, given that their test result is positive**. Before computing the exact answer arithmetically, first give a rough intuitive answer merely by looking at the relative frequencies in the row D = +. Does your intuitive answer match the intuitive answer you provided when originally reading about Table 5.4? Probably not. Your intuitive answer here is probably much closer to the correct answer. Now compute the exact answer arithmetically. It should match the result from applying Bayes’ rule in Table 5.4."

    "(C) Now we’ll consider a related representation of the probabilities in terms of natural frequencies, which is especially useful when we accumulate more data. This type of representation is called a “Markov” representation by Krauss, Martignon, and Hoffrage (1999). Suppose now we start with a population of N = 10, 000, 000 people. We expect 99.9% of them (i.e., 9,990,000) not to have the disease, and just 0.1% (i.e., 10,000) to have the disease. Now consider how many people we expect to test positive. Of the 10,000 people who have the disease, 99%, (i.e., 9,900) will be expected to test positive. Of the 9,990,000 people who do not have the disease, 5% (i.e., 499,500) will be expected to test positive. **Now consider re-testing everyone who has tested positive on the first test. How many of them are expected to show a negative result on the retest?** Use this diagram to compute your answer:"
