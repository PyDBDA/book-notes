## Building the GitHub Pages site

You need to have the following python packages installed:

* `nbconvert`
* `nbformat`
* `jinja2`

In the root of this repository, run something like the following:

    python build_docs.py *.ipynb

Which will convert all of the .ipynb files in the directory root to html, build
an index page, and stash all the html in the `docs/` folder, which is where it
needs to be for GitHub Pages to work.
